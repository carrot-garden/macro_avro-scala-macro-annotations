The state's need to sell off surplus power secured under\\nthose contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed\\n$43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and\\nblackouts that never materialized.\\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in\\nCalifornia Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy\\ncompanies say that the California ISO's purchasing decisions are\\ndifficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a\\nletter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight\\nand enforcement.\\nThe letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water\\nResources - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's\\nstruggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators, all of\\nwhich were to attend the meeting.\\n\"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch\\nprocedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last\\nnine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the\\ncurrent market structure,\" Wolfman said in her letter. \"The purpose of\\nthe meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that\\nparticipate in the scheduling and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR)\\non appropriate practices and procedures.\"\\nISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC\\nThe ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in\\nbalance on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO\\ndetermines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers\\nto buy power from.\\nIf the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an\\naudit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has\\nmanipulated the market, Wolfman's office said.\\n\"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational\\naudit of CAISO,\" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and\\nenforcement division states. \"This unprecedented examination of CAISO\\noperations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of\\nmarket manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be\\ninvestigated.\"\\nThe ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest\\npower first.\\n\"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory\\nthat the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus\\nDWR power at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political\\nembarrassment,\" the second letter says.\\nThe ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and\\ndeclined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss\\nMonday's meeting.\\nGenerators Confused\\nGenerators, including Mirant Corp.

That's because,\\naccording to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive\\npower into the market as \"out-of-market\" purchases that aren't averaged\\ninto the real-time prices that ISO market participants see.\\nDWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request,\\nDWR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being\\nmade in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from\\nDWR's long-term contracts.\\nThe out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According\\nto the ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for\\npeak hours was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49\/MWh on the\\nISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have\\nbeen lower than the out-of-market prices for months.\\nNone of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.\\nThe meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom,\\nCalif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the\\nstate are expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman\\nsaid. The meeting isn't open to the public.\\nThe meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices\\nand operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed\\nto improve the market.\\n\"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed\\nto by all the market participants and that is consistent with good\\nutility practices,\" Wolfman said in the letter.\\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\\njason.leopold@dowjones.com <mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com>\\n    \\n - winmail.dat ", "tos": [{"address": "jdasovic@enron.com", "name": "\"Jeff Dasovich \""}, {"address": "drothrock@camfg.com", "name": null}, {"address": "cohnap@sce.com", "name": "\"Ann Cohn \""}, {"address": "smutny@iepa.com", "name": "\"Jan Smutny-Jones \""}, {"address": "fieldejr@sce.com", "name": "\""}, {"address": "brbarkovich@earthlink.net", "name": null}, {"address": "dominic.dimare@calchamber.com", "name": "\""}, {"address": "kt@a-klaw.com", "name": "Karen Terranova"}, {"address": "mdjoseph@adamsbroadwell.com", "name": "\"Marc Joseph \""}, {"address": "debinorton@aol.com", "name": "\""}, {"address": "cra@calretailers.com", "name": "\""}, {"address": "derek.naten@roche.com", "name": null}, {"address": "vjw@cleanpower.org", "name": "\"John White \""}, {"address": "robert.albergotti@asm.ca.gov", "name": null}, {"address": "liebmand@haynesboone.com", "name": null}, {"address": "lys@a-klaw.com", "name": "Linda Sherif"}, {"address": "mflorio@turn.org", "name": "\"Mike Florio \""}, {"address": "isenberg@hmot.com", "name": null}, {"address": "tmcmorrow@manatt.com", "name": null}, {"address": "wbooth@booth-law.com", "name": null}, {"address": "dhunter@s-k-w.com", "name": null}, {"address": "lga@mother.com", "name": "\"Lenny Goldberg \""}, {"address": "jstewart@cmta.net", "name": "\""}, {"address": "john.redding@gene.ge.com", "name": null}, {"address": "ek@a-klaw.com", "name": "\""}, {"address": "kmccrea@sablaw.com", "name": "\"Keith McCrea \""}, {"address": "mkahl@ka-pow.com", "name": null}], "ccs": [], "bccs": []}

Should we request written notification from Wildhorse related to the \\nshut-in status of Entrada production?  Should we request written notification \\nrelated to the recent curtailment of Dakota production?  [As we've discussed, \\nEnogex never requested anything in writing from Wildhorse, so we do not have \\nany historic documentation of Wildhorse's claims].\\n\\n B.  Should we identify (potential) contractual issues due to the curtailment \\nof Dakota production; e.g.  Sec. 6 detailing the (wellhead) delivery pressure \\nrequirements under this contract, et al?  [As we've discussed, the system \\npressures have increased due to (initially) gas being re-routed by Wildhorse \\nover the past two years which has loaded the San Arroyo system, and now the \\nNWPL quality issues and subsequent Wildhorse curtailments has increased \\npressures system-wide.  If Wildhorse based their ability to allow these \\nproblems to persist by referring to Sec. 7 \"Gas Quality\" of the agreement, \\nwhat remedies can we request....partial release of Dakota gas?].\\n\\nHere's the frustration, based on conversations with producers in the area and \\nthe documents we've received from Enogex, Wildhorse has continued to attach \\nnon-pipeline quality spec gas to their system over the past couple years to \\nincrease gathering revenues, yet has not invested any $$$ for processing of \\nthis gas to meet or exceed the specs of downstream pipelines.

The integrity and high purpose you stand for is a\\npersonal inspiration to me.  Seeing your leadership first-hand has been a\\nreal treat.\\n\\nReceiving the Chairman's Award last year was an incredible honor.  It is\\ndifficult for me to feel truly deserving of it because of the sheer numbers\\nof amazingly dedicated, yet unrecognized heroes I have met at Enron.  I have\\nthe greatest admiration of them and draw my inspiration from them.\\n\\nOne regret in leaving is that there will be those at Enron who will use my\\ndeparture as more negative fodder to taint the company image.  I wouldn't\\never wish that on you, especially in light of the recent challenges you are\\nexperiencing.  So I apologize if that does come to pass.\\n\\nOne factor in my departure has been my disappointment with personnel abuses\\nI've observed with EES' origination management.  There is a general feeling \\nof despair because the management chain looks the other way and the concept \\nof an \"open door\" is political suicide.  H.R. is as much at fault in my \\nopinion because they side with management as opposed to taking an objective \\nview and judgement of the abuses.  My words and credibility may not carry \\nany weight as I too have been victimized by the character assassination \\nthat is all too common at EES.\\n\\nThough my emotions run high when I think about the injustices to good employees \\n(and lost potential benefit to Enron), I leave with no bad feelings toward the company\\nand am proud to have been a part of Enron.\\n\\nThe shift in EES' business model had resulted in my taking on a new role this\\npast spring.  Being based outside of Houston (in the Chicago area), my career\\nopportunities are limited.  And as much as I tried, I was feeling stale and\\nunfulfilled in this new role and decided that it would be better for me to\\nmove on.\\n\\nKen, I believe in you and wish you success and redemption through this difficult \\ntime.  I wish that I could have done more.  \\n\\nIf I can ever help, I hope that you won't hesitate to ask.

We argue that analyzing bank \\nliquidity risk  can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis. After \\nintroducing some  concepts and definitions, the presentation defines a \\nframework allowing to  measure a bank's structural liquidity risk. It then \\nshows that combining the  framework with modern credit risk measurement tools \\nleads to a liquidity risk  VAR measure. The presentation then offers \\nconcluding comments on the integration  of the liquidity risk measurement \\nframework within enterprise-wide risk  management.\\n\\n\\nThe Impact of Electronic Trading on the Uses  of Quantitative Research in \\nEquity Options \\nSeptember 22,  2000\\nScott Morris\\nHull Group, Quantitative Research Department  \\n\\n\\n\\nQuantitative Research in Investment  Management \\nOctober 6, 2000\\nRaman Srivastava  & Anna Bulkovshteyn\\nAssistant Vice President, & Fixed Income,  Quantitative Analysts, Putman \\nInvestments\\n\\n[IMAGE]\\nTBA \\nNovember 3,  2000\\nVince Kaminski\\nEnron Corp.\\n\\n\\nFund Management and Market  Efficiency \\nNovember 10, 2000\\nAndrea  Dalton\\nResearcher, Friess Associates \\n(advisor to the Brandywine  Funds).\\n\\n\\nTBA \\nNovember 17,  2000\\nJeff Keifer & Deb\\nAEP\\n\\n\\nTutorial on BRIDGE  \\nNovember 24, 2000\\nPierre Ste-Marie & Punit  Rawal\\nMSCF Students\\n\\n\\nA Corporate Risk Management  Framework \\nDecember 8, 2000\\nDarin Aprati &  Brian Moore\\nMcDonald's\\n\\n\\n\\n[IMAGE]Math Speaker  Series Schedule 2000-2001\\n[IMAGE]Speaker Series Student  Committee\\n[IMAGE]Previous Speakers\\n\\n\\n?\\n \\nPierre-Philippe  Ste-Marie\\n--------------------------------------\\n[IMAGE]http:\/\/pstemarie.homestead.com", "tos": [{"address": "ginas@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "htanaka@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "yangw@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "tyap@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "jiangz@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "heapho@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "tb2p@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "ketan@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "eac3@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "ignaciod@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "kgarrett@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": "\"Kent Garrett\""}, {"address": "aeh@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "kheo@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "tholden@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "khowes@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "sdj@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "hiroshi2@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "cwl@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "pozgediz@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "fqian@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": "\"Frank Qian\""}, {"address": "prawal@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": "\"punit rawal\""}, {"address": "orchuma@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": null}, {"address": "ps5@andrew.cmu.edu", "name": "Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie"}], "ccs": [], "bccs": []}

While\\nwidespread cold is still not likely, widespread storminess is.\\nThe above headlines are the same from my last post six days ago. That\\npattern seems to have verified well and it looks to continue through this\\nweek as well. One notable difference though is the trough in the West is\\nstronger as well as the ridge in the East. This will have an effect on\\ntemperatures and subsequent precipitation type. A series of storms should\\nmove through the nation this week. A couple of them look noteworthy. In the\\nEastern U.S. the rain\/snow line should be much farther North this time\\naround. In fact, enough warm air could be in place over the deep South for\\na severe weather outbreak Wednesday and Thursday. There could be some\\ndecent snows in the NE again late in the period, but the storm system will\\nneed to take a more Northerly track than I expect. A strong SW flow of air\\nwill overwhelm the Eastern half of the nation with double digit above\\nnormal air, especially once the melting of this weekends snowfall is\\nfinished. The trough in the West is sufficiently strong to produce below\\nnormal temperatures this week West of the divide. Precipitation could\\nbecome quite heavy later in the week especially in the Pacific NW. There is\\na slight concern that arctic air could get into the Pacific NW late in the\\nperiod. There continues to be an abundance in Western Canada. I have seen\\nreports of temperatures in Northern Saskatchewan this weekend approaching\\n60 below zero. It is too close to dismiss entirely, but I still see no real\\nsign of it pressing Southward.\\nHere is a shocker for those interested in the 6-10 day period. The MRF\\nbrings a significant shot of arctic air into the Northern U.S.! I guess\\nthis continues to be a case of predict it often enough and you'll\\neventually be right. To be fair, there was some cold this weekend in the\\nNorthern Plains. Minneapolis dropped below zero for the first time this\\nwinter Saturday morning. Of course the normal low for the date is around 3\\ndegrees. Again I suppose it can't be entirely written off since its in the\\nCanadian vicinity. But, it remains locked to the North on the Canadian and\\nEuropean solutions and I'll stay on the same horse until bucked. This\\nbattle only applies to the far North anyway as all signs show the Southern\\nhalf of the country arctic free and largely above normal.\\nFor the period Monday January 21 through Friday January 25, expect the\\nfollowing temperature trends:\\nAverage 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,\\nCalifornia...\\nAverage 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Pacific NW...\\nAverage 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Southern Plains and Rockies...\\nAverage 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Central Plains,\\nMississippi Valley, Northern and Central Rockies...\\nAverage 7 to 12-degrees above normal: Northern Plains, Great Lakes, Ohio\\nValley, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast...\\nAndy Weingarten, Meteorologist APB Energy \/ True Quote\\n", "tos": [{"address": "weathernews@apbenergy.com", "name": "Weather News Distribution"}], "ccs": [], "bccs": []}

No significant power plants have been built in\\nthe state in 10 years, and no additional supply is expected to go on line\\nuntil the middle of next year.

A written legal opinion has been requested.  The \\nthought of the Linklaters attorneys (both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker) \\nand tentatively Wade is that the MERC may be DPC's worst enemy if it has \\njurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA (which it will) and must approve it; \\nthus, it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction \\nover merit order dispatch.    The strategy isn't fully formed yet, but I \\nwonder about the wisdom of (i) taking on a regulator that could be in a \\nposition to approve a renegotiated PPA; and (ii) how a jurisdictional \\nchallenge to a regulator attempting to restructure squares with Enron's \\npositions\/reputation worldwide.

Upon return after New Year's, Akshay and I will \\nlook at the items in italics below.  Of course, we cannot do analysis out of \\nthe context of the model.  Perhaps if you sent Akshay and me the model that \\nis being used to work the answers to Jim's questions (one model or two?), we \\ncan see what we're working with currently.  \\n\\nPlease note the following:\\n\\n1. Merit Order Dispatch in the Next Rate Case.Attached below is what my team \\n(Robert Neustaedter) has drafted for the rate case filing on merit order \\ndispatch.  There is a mistake on page 5 regarding the percentage TOP that \\nneeds to pass outside merit order dispatch (it's 75% rather than 78%).  \\nFurther, we've asked Ramu to \"Indianize\" the text before we pass it back to \\nMr Palumvar.  Merit order dispatch has not been clearly treated by the MERC \\n(or any other Commission other than the Gujarat ERC), and this filing should \\nserve as a foundation for this rate case (and others).   \\n\\n\\n2. Merit Order Dispatch \"Cap\".  The May 5, 2000, order treats two concepts as \\none: the least cost purchase policy that determines what power purchase costs \\nare included in the rates for the rate case period is equated with merit \\norder dispatch, which is  a day-to-day operational tool that determines \\nactual purchases.  The rate case order of May 5, 2000, as written, did not \\n\"cap\" the quantities.  What the rate case stated (and I am not quoting) was \\nthat quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long \\nas the average realisation exceeded the cost.  I would also argue that the \\nIndia obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further \\ndispatch quantities.  The \"catch\" is in two places:  first, whether dispatch \\nof DPC power meets the test (Shubh told me recently it did -- does this \\ncontinue to hold true, Mohan?), and second, the recovery of the power \\npurchase costs due to the variance (the difference between what is authorized \\nin the order and what is actually dispatched.)\\n3. Recovery of Variance. According to Mr Podder, the Electricity Supply Act, \\n1948, does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the \\nnext.  (Typically, the variance is just included in the next rate case.  This \\npractice actually provides a utility with an opportunity to overrecover costs \\nfor a period of time, which is why the goal of a rate case is normally to \\nunderstate demand.  We have approached the MSEB  rate case, however, with a \\ndifferent perspective in an attempt to get the revenues up to allow more \\nfunds for MSEB to pay its bills.)  As provided in the Act, the variance must \\neither be subsidised by the State or absorbed by the SEB.  This is a major \\nfinancial problem for the SEBs and should be rectified by GOI.  Mr. Podder is \\nwriting down the accounting legal basis in Act, and I will forward that memo \\nto you.\\n4. MSEB Representation regarding dispatch.MSEB clearly discusses its failure \\nto dispatch more than 3044 MU with us in the rate case process.  Mr. Palumvar \\nand Mr. Bakshi state that failure to dispatch additional quantities is simply \\na matter of budget.  The cost of 3044 MU is incuded in the rates, and the \\ncost of additional volumes isn't.  Since there is no way for MSEB to collect \\nthe cost for additional volumes other than from the State, it is logically \\nnot dispatching additional volumes.\\n5. MERC Jurisdiction. Thus, I have a query: let's assume that the MERC does \\nnot have jurisdiction to determine least cost purchases or merit order \\ndispatch or to determine a blend of the two.  I'm not sure how that will help \\nMSEB to recover the full costs of its power purchases.\\n6. Logical Area of Focus. In my opinion, once Sandeep Katwala and team \\nconfirms our interpretation of the Act, the most beneficial course of action \\nwould be to work with the regulators\/Government\/anyone else to repair the \\ncost recovery mechanism of the Act.  This helps DPC, this helps MSEB and \\nwill, in the end, help the country.\\n\\nMight be worth considering. \\n---------------------- Forwarded by Jane Wilson\/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on \\n12\/27\/2000 08:23 AM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nSandeep Kohli\\n12\/21\/2000 01:41 AM\\nTo: Mohan Gurunath\/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\\ncc: Wade Cline\/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jane \\nWilson\/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \\n\\nSubject: Re: Dabhol question  \\n\\nMohan,\\n\\nI have gone through your note, and agree with the concept.  \\n\\nYou do have to compare end-user tariff with costs till end-user, which will \\ninclude T&D losses.\\nYou have assumed 30% loss figures which is assuming little or no improvement \\n(since this is the worst case scenario) \\nYour assumptions on Rs. devaluation are also aggressive as they need to be \\nfor a pessimistic scenario\\nYou have assumed that MSEB's average realization per unit in $ terms actually \\ngoes down due to Rs. devaluation\\n\\nThere are some areas where Jane can shed more light:\\nMSEB can increase its average realization, simply by limiting supply to agri. \\ncustomers, and by not giving any new unmetered connections\\nThe latter is something that has been decreed by MERC (Jane please correct me \\nif I am wrong), while the former was the most likely cause for Bhave's exit\\nJane - Can you (with Akshaya's help) take a crack at what the agricultural \\nload and unmetered customers are likely to be in the years 2002 through 2004 \\n?  Similarly, what is the likely growth in the metered cutomer categories?\\nAlso, if Dabhol were to be despatched to the load center at Mumbai (following \\nMohan's conclusion of 75% PLF on  2400 MW), and the plants close to \\nChandrapur were to despatch less, what would be the overall T&D loss picture \\n?  \\nThe question to answer here is what portion of the 30% is theft, and what is \\nactual T&D loss.  My understanding is that betwen 16-18% is actual T&D loss \\ndue to the poor state of the network.  Further, we will have to ask the \\nquestion whether the actual T&D loss is more due to distribution or due to \\ntransmission.  My gut feel is that it is due to distribution.\\nThe next logical question to tackle then would be what you see as the \\nimprovement in distibution between now and 2004.  Jane - Can you take a crack \\nat that ?\\n\\nMohan - My gut feel is that there will not be a 75% despatch on all three \\nblocks.  I can envisage that type of despatch in Block B, but that will be \\nthe optimistic rather than the pessimistic scenario.  I do not see C being \\nused more than 6-8 hours daily, and that too only in the peak season.  I had \\nstarted the team working on a stack and peak and off-peak load curves.  We \\nneed to do more on that.\\n\\nBottom line is that we need much more detailed information on the T&D sector, \\non the pace of reform, and most importantly on merit order deptaching of the \\nplants (building the stack of plants).  This was Jim's concern too when we \\nmet this morning, and we will need to develop a plan to move that forward \\nfurther.\\n\\nRegards,\\nSandeep.\\n\\n\\n\\nMohan Gurunath\\n12\/20\/2000 09:35 PM\\nTo: Wade Cline\/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\\ncc: Sandeep Kohli\/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jane \\nWilson\/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \\nSubject: Re: Dabhol question  \\n\\nAttached is an analysis of Jim's question for your review\/comments.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegards\\nMohan\\n\\n\\nTo: Mohan Gurunath\/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Sandeep \\nKohli\/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jane \\nWilson\/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: Dabhol question\\n\\nCan you 3 Amigos look into this and come back to me with a joint response for \\nJim?

I've enjoyed working out with Joel;\\nhe's a good \"kid\" and I can certainly relate to his Midwest roots and Iowa\\nState background. I grew up on a grain\/livestock farm in Gladbrook, Iowa, a\\ntown of under 1,000 people, and did my BS at Iowa State and MBA at Kansas\\nUniversity.\\n\\nI'm currently working as Director, Business Development at RedMeteor.com,\\nan\\ninternet-based energy brokerage company. We compete against Altra Energy,\\nEnronOnline, InterContinentalExchange and HoustonStreet. We started with\\n$22\\nmillion in venture capital, but need an additional infusion of capital to\\nbuild out our business model. I think it's going to be difficult for us to\\nattract additional funding in this climate, so I'm interested in making a\\nmove to another employer when I find the right fit.\\n\\nAs I mentioned this morning, I've been talking with Conoco recently (my\\nprevious employer for 9 years) as well as Enron's Broadband Services group.\\nI'm looking for a Houston-based business development position that would\\nbuild on my eCommerce experience at RedMeteor or my oil & gas pipeline\\noperations background. I've also met with Reliant Energy recently although\\nI\\nunderstand they've suspended hiring in their trading\/eCommerce groups due\\nto\\nthe California crisis.\\n\\nAny suggestions you would have would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.\\n\\nBrent Larsen\\nW: 281\/243-6527\\nC: 832\/724-7666\\n\\n\\n(See attached file: B Larsen 2-16-01.doc)\\n\\n - B Larsen 2-16-01.doc", "tos": [{"address": "jeff.skilling@enron.com", "name": null}], "ccs": [], "bccs": []}

The Atlantic ridge will prevail? for now.***\\n\\n     A series of weather systems will move into the West Coast and head\\nEast through the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. While the pattern will be\\nmore active than recent weeks, no one big storm is likely to bring travel\\nproblems on a large scale. In addition, there is little additional cold air\\navailable to spin up a Winter Storm, so most precip will be in the form of\\nlight to moderate rain. Exceptions to this will be the mountains of the\\nWest where ski resort snows will fall. Also, the far Northern reaches of\\nthe U.S. could see some light snows. Temperature departures are expected to\\ngo largely above normal again with the highest numbers in the North, though\\nnot to the degree of earlier in the month. Negative numbers though not\\nsignificant are confined to the West where storms come in off the ocean and\\nin the Southeast where this time of year is not cold anyway.\\n\\n     Models are going wild with a winter storm early in the 6-10 day\\nperiod. I suspect surface pressures are a little overdone given the upper\\nlevel flow. However, the Gulf will be open and some significant moisture\\nand wind are possible. The storm track will be well North which confines\\nsnow to the Northern U.S. Significant winter weather though from Wyoming to\\nMinnesota is possible. The large scale pattern ending November will be for\\na trough to sit in the Interior West while a strong ridge exists over the\\nSoutheast.  There is still plenty of arctic air available in Canada, but\\nwith the jet stream in a broad West to SW flow, no means of delivery appear\\navailable until at least December 1'st. In a general sense, I look for\\ntemperatures to be below normal in the West with above normal in the South\\nand East. The North is somewhat a question mark being closer to the arctic\\nair and could go either way. I'll lean to normal for now.\\n\\nFor the period Wednesday November 21 through Sunday November 25, expect the\\nfollowing temperature trends:\\n\\nAverage 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic,\\nPacific NW?\\n\\nAverage 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Ohio and Mississippi Valleys, Great\\nLakes, Southern Plains, California, Desert SW?\\n\\nAverage 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Rockies, Intermountain West, Central\\nPlains?\\n\\nAverage 7 to 10-degrees above normal:  Northern Plains?\\n\\nAndy Weingarten, Meteorologist  APB Energy \/ True Quote\\n\\n", "tos": [{"address": "weathernews@apbenergy.com", "name": "Weather News Distribution"}, {"address": "newweather@apbenergy.com", "name": "Weather Archive"}], "ccs": [], "bccs": []}

A two part \\nrate is a rate where customers pay their historical rate for consumption of \\nnormal load and pay market value for consumption incremental (or decremental) \\nto normal load.\\nThe CPUC should define normal consumption as consumption over and above 90% \\nof historical 2000 consumption.\\nThe CPUC should define the hourly rate as the highest hourly price paid by \\nDWR for spot purchases in that hour.\\nIn the event that implementation of two part RTP\/TOU rates is complicated to \\ndesign, the $30\/MWh surcharge should be applied to all customers until the \\nimplementation of two part RTP\/TOU rates is possible.\\nThe current draft design, of the CPUC, is discriminatory to large customers.\\nThe current draft design, of the CPUC, does not provide appropriate price \\nsignals.\\nThe current draft design, of the CPUC, results in rate increases to large \\ncustomers that are unneccessarly high.\\nThe current draft design, of the CPUC, results in rate increases to large \\ncustomers, that are far in excess of those which the CPUC intended.\\nThe current draft design, of the CPUC, results is static and does not respond \\nto changing market conditions.\\n\\nDesign Goals:\\nThe CPUC should design rates that:\\nGive appropriate price signals to customers to consume \/ conserve energy as \\nas close to marginal price as possible in as many hours as possible.\\nTreat all rate classes in a fair and consistent manner.\\nAchieve targeted revenue requirements.\\nAre easy to administer and understand.\\n\\nSummary of CPUC Illustrative Design:\\nThe CPUC has proposed rates that move on peak pricing in the summer close to \\nmarginal rates:\\nDraft proposal provides marginal price signal of about $370\/MWh for E19 \\nSecondary from in Summer Weekdays from noon to 6PM\\nDraft proposal provides marginal price signal of about $75\/MWh for E19 \\nSecondary from in all other hours.\\nCritique based on Design Goals:\\nDraft proposals move toward marginal rates but fall short.\\nThe rates for power, Mar 30 2001, based on DJ-NP15, on peak is $181.94\/MWh.\\nThe rates for power, Mar 30 2001, based on DJ-NP15, off peak is $93.46\/MWh.\\nThe proposed marginal rates for E19 Secondary, is $75\/MWh for on peak and off \\npeak.\\nThis rate design will not encourage investments in assets that result in \\nlower consumption in the winter or in off peak periods.\\n Draft proposal falls short on treating customers on a consistent basis:\\nE20 Transmission Voltage customers will experience a 87% rate increase.\\nE19 Secondary voltage customers will experience a 41% rate increase.\\nA10 Medium General Service customers will experience a 20% rate increase.\\nA1 Small L&P customers will experience a 16% rate increase.\\nThe marginal price signal for A10 will be $121\/MWh vs $370\/MWh for E-20 \\ntransmission in the on peak summer.\\nThe marginal price signal for E10 wills be 107\/MWh vs $55\/MWh for E-20 \\ntransmission in the off peak periods.\\nPGE has a longer summer period than SCE.  This results in a 69% increase for \\nSCE TOU-8-Sub as compared to 87% increases for PGE E20 Transmission rate.  \\nThe proposal also results in far different marginal price signals for SCE \\ncustomers than PGE customers.  For example the on peak rate for SCE TOU-8-Sub \\nis $128\/MWh as compared to PGE E20 Transmission rate of $374\/MWh.\\nDraft proposal does do a good job of recovering $2.2b of revenue.\\nDraft proposal require some implementation but given that the surcharge \\nincrease does not ocur until May for PGE and June for SCE, it should be \\npossible to implement.\\n\\nEnron Proposed Rates:\\nEnron proposes:\\nTwo part real time pricing time of use rate,\\nUsage up to 90% of historical use would be billed at historical rates.\\nUsage incremental or decremental to 90% of historical use, would be billed at \\nDJ-NP15 On Peak and DJ-NP15 Off Peak, where customers has real time metering.\\nUsage incremental or decremental to 90% of historical use, would be billed at \\nDJ-NP15 On Peak and DJ-NP15 Off Peak averaged over the month, where customers \\nhas time of use metering.\\nUsage incremental or decremental to 90% of historical use, would be billed at \\n45% of DJ-NP15 On Peak and 55% of DJ-NP15 Off Peak averaged over the month, \\nwhere customers has just energy metering.\\nCritique based on Design Goals:\\nEnron proposals charge all customer at very close  to marginal rates.\\nThus, within the constraints of using Dow Jones, the rates should be very \\nclose to the actual marginal rates.\\nThe rates will not be exact because they are:\\nDetermined on the previous day\\nOny differentiate between on and off peak, as compared to hour by hour.\\nTo the extent that the customer does not have real time metering capability, \\nthe rates will be determined on a class average basis.\\nHowever, the rates be far superior to the CPUC draft design because:\\nThey give better price signals to night consumption\\nThey give better signals to weekend consumption\\nThey give better signals to winter consumption\\nThey are self correcting in that they do not require predetermination of \\nmarginal costs.  For example, if summer costs are lower, the rate will be \\nlower.\\nThe Enron proposal will motivate DSM activities in winter, summer and off \\npeak.\\nEnron proposal results in similar rate structure and impact regardless of \\nutility and rate class.\\nThe Enron proposal results in a similar concept for commerical and industrial \\nas with residential.  AB1X provides that residential customers that consume \\nenergy below normal rates will not have increased rates.  This design also \\nachieves the same effect for commercial and industrial customers.\\nDraft proposal does do a good job of recovering $2.2b of revenue but even \\nmore importantly it ensures tracking of costs.\\nSetting the normal load at 90% of historical load results in a $30\/MWh \\nincrease if the market value for the entire year is $300\/MWh.\\nIn the event that the market value for the entire year is less than $300\/MWh, \\nthe resulting cost decreases will offset the lost revenue.\\nThe Enron proposed rate design structure is flexi ble enough that it can \\neasily be changed to achieve greater or lessor revenue to achieve price \\nsignals and revenue targets.\\nThe revenue outcome is less certain than the CPUC draft design however the \\nimpact should be more certain because the revenue will automatically go up \\nwhen the costs go up.\\nDraft proposal require greater implementation details than the CPUC design \\nbut such extra costs are worthwhile.\\nThe Enron proposal requires:\\nDetermination of historical loads for large customers\\nDetermination of class consumption profiles for demand metered customers\\nDetermination of class consumption profiles for energy metered customers\\nDetermination of customer profiles in the event that the customers is a new \\ncustomer\\nThen Enron proposal has the following negatives:\\nSome customers who have reduced load from historical levels will be better \\noff even though they have not changed their behaviour in response to the new \\nprice signals\\nThe rates will require greater administrative costs since they are different \\nfor each customer.\\nThe rates may take more work to put in place for the utility\\nThe rates will result in similar customers paying dissimilar rates, depending \\nupon the historical consumption of the customers\\n\\nQ.  In the event that it is not possible to implement the Enron rates by June \\n1, 2001, what would you propose a an interim solution:\\nA.  The CPUC draft rates are so flawed, that it would be superior to just \\nimplement a flat $30\/MWh surcharge to all customers.  This approach would be \\nfairer and simpler.\\n\\nQ.  Who would pay for the decremental consumption of customers?\\nA.  The DWR will incur a decline in their costs equal to the decrease in \\nrates of the utilities.  The are indifferent to buy more generation or \\nselling less energy to customers.  Thus the DWR should be willing to pay for \\ndecremental consumption.  In the event that the DWR is not agreeable to \\npaying for decremental consumption, the utility should be allowed to borrow \\nsuch funds and have the costs amortized for the next 10 years.  In the event \\nthat the utility is unable to fund decremental consumption, the normal load \\ncould be defined 85% of historical and the CPUC could eliminate credits \\nresulting from decremental consumption.  Such solution would discourage \\nconservation below 15% but would not be expected to diminish the \\neffectiveness of the Enron proposed rates.\\n\\nQ.  Why is DJ-NP15 the right index to choose?\\nA.  DJ-NP15 and DJ-SP15 are availble for each weekday for on and off peak \\npricing.  The index is a mathematical average of trades in the previous day \\nfor today.  The DJ index is compiled based on the information provided by \\nmany of the large trading companies including Enron.  The numbers provided by \\nthe participants are subject to audit.  Thus DJ is the best avaible \\ninformation available for energy pricing.\\n\\nQ.  What index is suitable for weekends?\\nA. Enron proposes that the average DJ-NP15 off peak energy charges for friday \\nand monday be used to determine the weekend rates for the purpose of rate \\nsetting.\\n\\n\\n", "tos": [{"address": "scott.stoness@enron.com", "name": null}], "ccs": [{"address": "james.steffes@enron.com", "name": null}, {"address": "don.black@enron.com", "name": "Don Black"}, {"address": "james.lewis@enron.com", "name": null}, {"address": "tamara.johnson@enron.com", "name": "Tamara Johnson"}, {"address": "jeff.dasovich@enron.com", "name": "Jeff Dasovich"}], "bccs": [{"address": "james.steffes@enron.com", "name": null}, {"address": "don.black@enron.com", "name": "Don Black"}, {"address": "james.lewis@enron.com", "name": null}, {"address": "tamara.johnson@enron.com", "name": "Tamara Johnson"}, {"address": "jeff.dasovich@enron.com", "name": "Jeff Dasovich"}]}
